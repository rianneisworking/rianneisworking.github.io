            <p>Cain's Jawbone is a murder mystery puzzle written by Edward Powys Mathers under the pseudonym "Torquemada". The puzzle was first published in 1934 as part of The Torquemada Puzzle Book. In 2019, crowdfunding publisher Unbound published a new stand-alone edition of the puzzle in collaboration with the charity The Laurence Sterne Trust.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="right">
            <p>The puzzle consists of a 100-page prose narrative with its pages arranged in the wrong order. To solve the puzzle, the reader must determine the correct order of the pages and also the names of the murderers and victims within the story. The story's text includes a large number of quotations, references, puns, Spoonerisms and other word games. There is only one correct order. The solution to the puzzle has never been made public.</p>

            This one is impossible to review, I've read the pages, cut them out, started a murderwall (heck yeah!) and now let the crime solving commence!
            Lots of historical and literary references to help you figure out the ordering of the pages, or the narrator of the page. This feels pretty impossible right now but I'm having fun!

            This is my new obsession.
            I am assembling a small and elite team of literary friends to crack this case. I'm talking mind maps, researching precise Latin names for plants, obscure ancient Greek references‚Äîthe whole shebang. For the uninitiated, Cain's Jawbone is a puzzle that was originally published in the 1930s by the brilliant and mysterious "Torquemada" (Edward Powys Mathers), a British crossword compiler educated at Oxford.
            Since its creation, only four people have been confirmed to solve it. With this reissuing by Unbound, prize money was offered to diligent readers in 2022 who could solve the (multiple!) murders. Now, they are accepting submissions throughout 2023 as well due to demand (though without a prize, boo).

            <p>E(dward) Powys Mathers was an English translator and poet, and also a pioneer of compiling advanced cryptic crosswords.</p>
            <p>Powys Mathers was born in Forest Hill, London, the son of a newspaper proprietor. He was educated at Loretto and Trinity College, Oxford.</p>
            <p>He was the editor with J.C. Mardrus of The Book of the Thousand Nights and One Night (his 12 volume English translation of the Mardrus adaptation appeared in 1923).</p>

            <p>He is known also for the translations The Garden of Bright Waters: One Hundred and Twenty Asiatic Love Poems (1920); and of the Kashmiri poet Bilhana in Bilhana: Black Marigolds (1919), a free interpretation in the tradition of Edward Fitzgerald.
